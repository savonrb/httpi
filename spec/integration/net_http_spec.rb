  # run the following integration test against a real external NTLM server from time to time.

  # Windows 2012 Server configured according to the instructions found here: 
  #   https://github.com/coldnebo/httpi/wiki/NTLM-Integration-Test-Plan
  # 
  # Once you have that server running as instructed, you can include this test by setting 
  # NTLM=external via the command line, e.g.: 
  #   $ NTLM=external bundle exec rspec
